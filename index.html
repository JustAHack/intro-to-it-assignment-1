    <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
    <h3>What is my interest in IT?</h3>
    <p>
      I became interested in IT during a IT class in high school in 2004, in one class 
      we were being taught about creating websites, I was given an introduction to
      html and css, and became interested in creating websites.

      My interest lead me to create my own website that provided guides and FAQs for a specific
      game series (Final Fantasy) in 2004. This turned into a hobby for about a year until I 
      found other interests at the time.

      After finishing high school I jumped between different jobs until I had an idea of what I enjoyed doing for work
      and finally decided to focus on IT in 2012
    </p>
    <h3>Why did I choose RMIT?</h3>
    <p>
      I chose RMIT because it was the only IT degree available on Open Universities Australia in 2018 that I believed was worth pursuing.
    </p>
    <h3>What do I expect to learn during my degree?</h3>
    <p>
      As I have been studying this degree since 2018, I expected to learn a lot of general informationl; perhaps not as much as I did
      about software and development as I did.

      It is my belief though that the most important skill I have learned from this degree is how to work with others in a team 
      to plan, design and implement software.

    <h2>Ideal job</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Job description</h3>
    <p>
      The position is for a Graduate / Junior Web App Developer who will be working on a student management system that
      is offered as a Software as a Service (SaaS). This role requires the successful applicant to 
      help the team build new features and products across their web and mobile platforms.

      What I find appealing is the aspect of working not only on the frontend of the software, but also the backend. 
      I really appreciate the ability to create great user experiences and enjoyable user interfaces that leave a user
      feeling satisfied rather than disatisfied with the software. I believe this position offers a more full experience
      in building great software as you can bridge the gaps between both the frontend and backend rather than just
      seeing one side of the software.
    </p>

    <h3>Required skills</h3>
    <p>
      A Bachelors degree or higher in IT or Computer science Understanding of tools relevant to the job
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Git</li>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>NodeJS</li>
      <li>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</li>
      <li>SQL</li>
      <li>Serverless technologies</li>
      <li>Issue tracking software e.g. Jira</li>
      <li>Design software e.g. Figma</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Along with the above mentioned requirements, the ideal candidate should have knowledge and understanding
      of the software development lifecycle, have experience in creating and contributing to software projects.
      The ideal candidate should also have a passion for software development and excellent communication skills.
    </p>

    <h3>Current skills and experience</h3>
    <p>
      I currently have a Diploma in Software Development and an Advanced Diploma in IT.
      I am also currently studying and have almost completed my Bachelor of IT at RMIT.
      I have some projects on my GitHub account, some public others are private and am
      working on more projects to further grow my portfolio and learn about software development.

      I have experience in software development from 2014 / 2015 where I was a solo developer
      and designed and created a custom system for managing employee scheduling. This experience
      involved communicating with the client, understanding their problem that needed solving,
      obtaining requirements, creating a plan and a system design, researching best tools for the
      job, developing, testing and delivering the software.
    </p>

    <h3>Plan for obtaining required skills for the position or a similar one in the future</h3>
    <p>
      My plan for gaining the missing skills, is to continue work on my portfolio on GitHub
      and work on my communication and teamwork skills. I believe my knowledge of software
      development and experience for the position are already met.

    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</h3>
    <p>
      The results of these tests certainly give me something to think about, in particular
      when it comes to the big five test as that I am traditional and conventional which
      I am unsure about, as I often think that I can sometimes come up with unique solutions
      although I don't mind following along with proven solutions.
    </p>

    <h3>How do I believe these results will influence my behaviour with my team?</h3>
    <p>
      I believe that these results will help me to understand and perhaps try different
      solutions when working with my team. Such as trying to be a little more extroverted
      or opinionated about ideas.
    </p>

    <h3>How should I take this information into account when forming a team?</h3>
    <p>
      It would be best to find a team that has members that can fill in the gaps where I 
      apparently have shortcomings. As these tests suggest I may be independent at times,
      easily stressed and have fluctating self-esteem. I should communicate a little more
      effectively, and find a team that is communicative.

    <h2>Project</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Discord is a widely used social media and communication tool loved and used by 
      millions of people around the world. However, what many users do not know is that
      Discord tracks every small detail about its users and what they are doing on the
      platform.

      What I propose to build is a similar product that provides many of the same features
      over time, but including other features that include far greater privacy for each
      user. 

      Including but not limited to text, audio and video communication. Ability to link
      to and communicate with other types of media such as other websites, games, software
      etc. Plugins built by users for games that can communicate back to this software
      providing information such as new loot obtained, levels gained, achievements gained etc.
    </p>

    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      Privacy is a major concern for everyone in this digital age. Peoples personal data is being
      sold without their knowledge because either people do not read the terms and services or 
      sometimes companies don't even let their users know what is happening with the data they
      obtain. This can lead to information being stolen or used for nefarious reasons after it
      has been sold to a third party.

      My goal is to create a service that people love to use, communicate and have fun with 
      their friends, families and peers while being assured that their data is their own and
      not be sold to any third party. This would be achievable with technology available today.
    </p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Discord provides a fantastic platform for its target audience but it has its pitfalls in terms
      of privacy. Discord supposedly does not encrypt user information on their servers, everything
      sits there ready to be accessed at any moment. It is not so much a matter of if, but when
      discord has a breach and data is stolen as we have seen with many other companies, including facebook
      among others. 

      It is my plan to build a more decentralised social media platform that revolves around games as its
      main focus while providing a place for communities, friends and peers to communicate freely and without
      tracking. 

      This could be achieved through the use of a project known as Matrix and some proper planning and design.

      Users should be able to host their own servers where people can join and communicate through text, audio
      and video as the main feature.

      Users should also be able to link their profiles to the platform and have privacy settings attached to
      their profiles so that they can feel comfortable to share only as much information as they are 
      happy to share publicly or privately.

      The platform should provide users the ability to create plugins by using an API to communicate data between
      their servers, profile etc and games. (E.g. achieving a new level, obtaining new gear, planning raids etc).

      Communities should be able to link third party social media and software
      to their servers through API.

      Communities can potentially create their own styling for their servers to fit their own themes to make
      a more engaging and rich experience.

      Authentication and authorisation to be built in so that accounts are secure.

      These are the bare minimum features for the product to succeed and a prototype to be built with.

      Users should be able to delete their messages on any server, personal chat room etc and that data be 
      permanently removed from all devices that message was sent to that is connected to currently and in
      future as to assure data is not permanently tracked and kept.
    </p>

    <h3>Tools and technologies required</h3>
    <p>
      HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for building the frontend of the software, so that a rich user experience
      can be provided and users can use the software on the web as well as on computer or mobile devices.

      A serverside language to help support the features and requirements of the project
      such as NodeJS, C#, Java etc. 

      Matrix from Matrix.org to provide the main functionality described above such as end-to-end encrypted 
      decentralised communications. Ability to communicate with third party programs such as Discord, Facebook
      WhatsApp, IRC, Mumble, LinkedIn Messaging, Twitter etc. 

      Figma for designing and prototyping frontend user interface and user experience.

      Git and GitHub for managing and tracking the code and relevant import files for the project.

      Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure for infrastructure hosting such as Amazons EC2 
      for hosting, Amazon S3 for cloud storage of images, Amazon DynamoDB for bare minimum data
      requirements (authentication)

      Trello for helping to manage requirements and progress on the project and direct / track tasks.

      A code editor (e.g. VS Code, Atom) to write code to build the underlying infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h3>Skills required</h3>
    <p>
      It's feasable to find the skills and knowledge for software development lifecycle as I
      personally know the cycle, and have experience in building software already.

      I have quite a bit of knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript and other frontend 
      technologies, as well as experience with backend technologies such as NodeJS, C#, Java and PHP.

      I have adequate knowledge of Databases both SQL and NoSQL.

      I have experience using both AWS services in the past, such as AWS EC2, S3 and DynamoDB.

      I do not however have any experience with the Matrix project and therefore have not used their software.
      However this is a perfect oppertunity to learn and understand it and put what I learn to practice.
      I have many years of experience creating software and am confident in my ability to quickly learn
      this software and it's API within a reasonable timeframe to create a minimum viable product (MVP).

      The other major issues are time and money, hosting services are seldom free, and when they are you
      have very little bandwidth and space available. As for time, we're given only 13 weeks per subject, and
      we're already down to 10 weeks left after this is submitted. 
    </p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
      All features mentioned above so far are feasible and not out of reach for any student including myself
      giving addequate time and skills. The bare minimum for a prototype would be to create a chatroom that
      provides text, audio and visual communication with authenitcation and authorisation built in with a 
      GUI. 

      There are some potential issues with this product however, such as time and cost. Although creating a 
      basic prototype is likely not difficult, providing a fully functioning MVP within
      the remaining 10 weeks is extremely unlikely given the skill level of the team. 

      Personally I know very little about the Matrix project beyond the research I have done so far, and my
      team have little to no knowledge of the project either.
